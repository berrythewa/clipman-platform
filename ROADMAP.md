# Project Roadmap: Cross-Device Synchronization Platform

## **Overview**
This project aims to build a cross-platform service for synchronizing clipboard and password data across devices with minimal UI and seamless user integration. It utilizes a WebSocket-based service for real-time communication and synchronization.

---

## **Current State of the Project**

### **Implemented Features**

#### **Models**
- **Clipboard Model**: Handles clipboard content for devices.
- **Device Model**: Manages device-specific metadata (e.g., device IDs, user associations).
- **User Model**: Stores user account information and relationships to devices.
- **Password Model**: Placeholder or partially implemented for password synchronization (pending).

#### **Services**
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and device authorization.
- **Clipboard Service**: Manages clipboard synchronization logic.
- **Device Service**: Registers and manages devices.
- **User Service**: Manages user-related operations.
- **WebSocket Service**: Partially handles real-time communication across devices.

#### **Handlers**
- **Auth Handler**: Manages authentication-related API endpoints.
- **Device Handler**: Handles device registration and management endpoints.
- **User Handler**: Handles user-specific API requests.
- **WebSocket Handler**: Implements WebSocket communication logic for sync.

## **Features to Be Implemented**

### **Core Features**
1. **Subscription Logic for WebSocket**
   - Devices should be able to subscribe to updates from specific other devices.
   - Ensure efficient subscription and broadcasting logic for clipboard and password data.

2. **Password Management**
   - CRUD operations for storing and managing passwords.
   - End-to-end encryption for secure storage and synchronization.
   - Strong password generator.

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data.
   - Access control to ensure devices can only access authorized data.

4. **Clipboard History**
   - Store clipboard history for users.
   - Allow users to access and sync clipboard history across devices.

5. **Offline Support**
   - Local caching of clipboard and password data.
   - Conflict resolution for sync when devices reconnect.

### **UI/UX Features**
1. **Minimal UI**
   - Android background service with minimal UI for configuration.
   - Lightweight desktop and mobile apps for password and clipboard management.

2. **Quick Actions**
   - Notification-based clipboard sharing.
   - One-click password copy/fill.

3. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - Browser extension for password autofill and clipboard access.

### **Scalability and Infrastructure**
1. **Message Broker Integration**
   - Redis for managing subscriptions and broadcasts efficiently in a distributed environment.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Ensure low-latency communication for real-time sync.
   - Optimize database and WebSocket performance.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Add tools like Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring.

### **Testing and Documentation**
1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all services and models.
   - Integration tests for API endpoints and WebSocket communication.

2. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive API documentation.
   - User guides for setting up and using the platform.
